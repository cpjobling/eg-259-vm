The definitive resource for information on [jQuery]() is the excellent [API documentation](http://api.jquery.com/) provided by the jQuery developer team. There is also a [jQuery Learning Centre](http://learn.jquery.com/) which provides numerous tutorial introductions to this important library.

You can also learn more by following the interactive jQuery course at [try.jquery.com](http://try.jquery.com/) and the [jQuery course at Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery). There are also over [200 videos on jQuery](http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=32) at the newboston.org.
